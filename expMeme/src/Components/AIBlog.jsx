        AI Meets Memes: The Future of Digital Humor with XPD AI
      </h1>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6 text-sm">
        In an age where content is consumed in microseconds and trends change at the speed of light, humor remains a constant. Memes are no longer just jokes; they are cultural commentary, viral marketing tools, and a universal language. With <strong>XPD AI</strong>, we’re not just generating memes — we’re redefining how humor is created and shared, powered by cutting-edge artificial intelligence.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl  mt-8 mb-4 text-pink-400 font-extralight">What is XPD AI?</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6 text-sm">
        XPD AI is a next-generation meme generation platform that uses the power of Google’s <strong>Gemini Pro API</strong> to turn your text prompts into high-quality memes in real time. Whether you want a clever caption, a viral image meme, or just some inspiration — XPD AI delivers with remarkable precision and personality.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-extralight mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-400">How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4  text-sm">
        Our system integrates the Gemini Pro model through Google’s Generative Language API (v1), allowing it to interpret user inputs with incredible nuance. Users can choose between generating a <strong>text-based meme</strong> (caption only) or an <strong>image-based meme</strong> using pre-defined or AI-selected meme templates.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-300 space-y-2 mb-6  text-sm">
        <li>Enter your idea (e.g., "Monday mornings in developer life").</li>
        <li>Select your meme type — text or image.</li>
        <li>Hit generate. Our AI crafts the perfect meme based on humor context, tone, and trending formats.</li>
        <li>Download or share directly from the interface. Easy, fast, fun.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-extralight mt-8 mb-4 text-yellow-400">Why AI for Memes?</h2>
